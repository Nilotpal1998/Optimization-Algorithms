<h1><b>The Vanilla Gradient Descent / Batch Gradient Descent </b> </h1>
<h2> Optimization Goals </h2>
<p>Optimization refers maily to two basic concepts :-</p>
<p>1.Minimization</p>
<p>2.Maximization</p>
<p>of the objective function <b>f(x)</b> parameterised by our independent variable x. In the Machine/Deep Learning terminology we are endowed with task of minimizing the loss function L(w) parameterised by the model parametres .</p>

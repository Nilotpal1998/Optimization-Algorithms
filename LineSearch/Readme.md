<h1><u>The Golden Section</u></h1>
<p>The <b>Golden Section Search</b> is  mainly a line search technique which helps us to find the extremum of a given function inside a specified interval.This reacts differently for unimodal and multimodal functions :-</p>
<p>1.For any unimodal funtion we find the extremum lying within the interval .</p>
<p>2.For multimodal data we will be able to find any one of the extremum lying within the interval.</p>
<p>This mainly itteratively narrows down the interval in which the extremum lies and due to this phenomenon the algorithm becomes very slow but the process becomes acutely robust.</p>
